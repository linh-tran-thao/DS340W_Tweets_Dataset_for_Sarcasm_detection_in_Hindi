Raw dataset having over 16000 tweets (including both sarcastic and non-sarcastic) for researchers aspiring to work on Sarcasm Detection in Hindi.

  **Number of Sarcastic tweets: 6051**
  
  **Number of Non-Sarcastic Tweets: 10128**
  
These tweets were extracted using tweet scrapping code from the Github repository of [Mr. Griffin Leow](https://github.com/leowgriffin/tweets_analysis_hkprotests_2019/blob/master/scraping_tweets.py)

It was tweaked to extract tweets in native Hindi and of specific hashtags.
The dataset has tweets for the duration 01-01-2012 to 23-06-2020.

Method #1: Run the `scrap_tweets_in_Hindi-v1.py` file via IDLE or Jupyter Notebook to re-scrap tweets from twitter.   
Method #2: Just download the Jupyter Notebook and run all the cells!   

P.S. If you are around, I won't mind if you star the repository! Thanks ;-)
